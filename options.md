### Show or cloak comments on page load

When you set up [**ghpages-ghcomments**](https://github.com/wireddown/ghpages-ghcomments/tree/release), you can specify when your readers see comments:

 * By default, comments are **loaded and cloaked**, and then presented when *"Show Comments"* is clicked or tapped.
 * Or, you can load and present them immediately.

### Use a custom label name and color

Since GitHub hosts your comment threads in your repository's Issues, you can use a custom label name and color for your site's comments threads.

If you have many Jekyll sites, you can **use one repository to host *all* of the comments** but group them by label and color for easy inspection.
