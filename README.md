# GitHub Comments for your GitHub Pages

With **ghpages-ghcomments**, your Jekyll site can use GitHub to provide reader comments. 

Set up is quick, and everything has been automated to hook into your git workflow.

# Advantages

### It's good for your readers
 1. **Your readers' web habits are not tracked** by services like [Disqus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus).
 1. **Your readers have full control** over their comments -- they can edit and delete them.
 1. **Page presentation is still Jekyll-fast** from lean built-in JavaScript -- no jQuery or other *"frameworks"*.
 1. **Customize the look and feel** with a small collection of CSS classes.

### It's good for you
 1. **You don't need your own dedicated server** to host a [Discourse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_%28software%29) instance.
 1. **Comment threads are automatically created** with every `git push` to your site.
 1. **Set up takes 5 minutes** and the rest is triggered -- set and forget.
 1. **Aggregate *all* of your sites' comments together** in one place -- a GitHub repository.
